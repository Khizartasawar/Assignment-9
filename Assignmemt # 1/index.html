        <p>HTML was created by Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee in late  and 
            released in <b>1993</b>, then HTML 2.0 was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was 
            published in late <b>1999</b> and was a<i> major version of HTML.</i>
            • HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information 
            that can be readable and accessible via web browsers.<u> But not many of the 
            developers were involved in creating websites.</u> So,<b> the language was also not 
            growing.</b>
            • <i> comes the HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the 
            features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features</i>,<u> which remained 
            as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 
            January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML</u> </p>
